# ASTRA - Asynchronous Scalable Task and Resource Actors

WIP - This is a work in progress and not yet ready for use.

ASTRA is a library for building applications using asynchronous actors. It is designed to be scalable and efficient, and to provide a simple and flexible API for building applications.

## Features

- Asynchronous actors
- Customizable backends (File, Memory, RDBMS, etc.)
- Scalable and efficient
- Simple and flexible API

## Installation

ASTRA is fully written in Rust and I'll make it available via crates.io soon.
